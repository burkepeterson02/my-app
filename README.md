# IS542 Web Development Final Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple basketball scoreboard app. The application features a game timer, shot clock timer, team names, and displays for socres, a possession arrow, bonus indicators, and foul counts.

## Running the Project

Simply navigating to the app link will open the scoreboard.

## API

I used an NBA API from Rapid API. This pulls NBA standings data. I display the NBA standings along the bottom of the screen in a scrolling span bar.
