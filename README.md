# IS542 Web Development Final Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple basketball scoreboard app. The application features a game timer, shot clock timer, team names, and displays information about scores, possession, bonus, and fouls. All of this information can be updated in real time using react state.

## Running the Project

Simply navigating to the app link will open the scoreboard. The app is hosted live via Github Pages.

## API
I used an NBA API from Rapid API. This pulls NBA standings data. I display the NBA standings along the bottom of the screen in a scrolling span bar.
